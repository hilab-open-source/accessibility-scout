Respond in JSON format. Return a list of different environment concerns. Be as comprehensive as possible, describing as many potential locations as possible. Do not assume too much about potential concerns. Only list the ones that are clear and present serious challenges. Respond in JSON. Each location should have a string field "name" that gives the name of the location, a string field "desc" that briefly describes where that location is in the environment, a string field "reason" that describes why that location in the environment is a concern.
