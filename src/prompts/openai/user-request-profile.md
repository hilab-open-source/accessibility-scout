Using my feedback, give me a full rundown of my abilities and preferences in JSON. The run down should have a string field "preferences" with a long string description of my accessibility concerns and needs. Each concerns and need should be contextualized to the actions they are involved in. Write as if you were in my perspective. You should be able to make general conjectures of my abilities and bodily features based on the collection of accessibility concerns.
